# Frontend branch update:

## Adds basic navbar, now able to switch between my recipes and explore page.

## Implements explore page's loaded recipes from api, now each time user enters explore page will render 5 random recipes.

## For styles, only got the layout done by now.

### Will do: delete console logs and write comments.

### Not sure if we can use Bootstrap js plugins.
